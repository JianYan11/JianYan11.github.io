        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section id="intro">
            <h2>What is Cybernetics?</h2>
            <p>
                Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary approach for exploring regulatory systems—their structures, constraints, and possibilities. 
                It is relevant to the study of mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive, and social systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                The term comes from the Ancient Greek <strong>"kubernetike"</strong>, meaning "the art of steering" or "governance". 
                Just as a steersman adjusts the rudder to stay on course despite changing winds and currents, cybernetic systems use 
                <strong>feedback</strong> to maintain stability and achieve goals.

        <!-- History -->
        <section id="history">
            <h2>History & Origins</h2>
            <p>
                While the concepts of feedback and control date back to ancient times (e.g., Ktesibios's water clock), modern cybernetics 
                was solidified in the 1940s.
            </p>
            <h3>Norbert Wiener</h3>
            <p>
                The field was formally defined by <strong>Norbert Wiener</strong> in his seminal 1948 book, 
                <em>"Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine"</em>. Wiener, a mathematician/philosopher, 
                recognized that the principles governing control in complex machines (like anti-aircraft guns) were strikingly similar 
                to those in biological nervous systems.
            </p>
            <h3>The Macy Conferences</h3>
            <p>
                Between 1946 and 1953, a group of scholars from diverse fields—mathematics, psychology, anthropology, and engineering—gathered 
                in New York for the <strong>Macy Conferences</strong>. These meetings were the crucible where cybernetics was forged, 
                bringing together giants like John von Neumann, Warren McCulloch, and Margaret Mead to develop a unified theory of the mind and machine.

        <!-- Core Concepts -->
        <section id="concepts">
            <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
            
            <h3>Feedback Loops</h3>
            <p>
                The heart of cybernetics. A system's output is "fed back" as input, creating a loop.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Negative Feedback:</strong> Counteracts change to maintain stability (Homeostasis). Example: A thermostat or the human body regulating temperature.</li>
                <li><strong>Positive Feedback:</strong> Amplifies change, leading to exponential growth or runaway effects. Example: Audio feedback or viral trends.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Entropy & Information</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Entropy</strong> is a measure of disorder. In cybernetics, systems fight against the natural tendency towards disorder (Second Law of Thermodynamics) 
                by processing <strong>Information</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Claude Shannon's</strong> Information Theory provided the mathematical framework to quantify this. A cybernetic system uses information 
                to reduce uncertainty and maintain its structure (Negentropy).

        <!-- Modern Applications -->
        <section id="applications">
            <h2>Modern Applications</h2>
            <p>
                Cybernetics is the ancestor of many modern fields. Its DNA is everywhere:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Neural networks and reinforcement learning are fundamentally cybernetic, relying on error correction (feedback) to learn.</li>
                <li><strong>Robotics:</strong> Autonomous robots use sensor-motor loops to navigate and interact with the world.</li>
                <li><strong>Biology & Medicine:</strong> Understanding the brain as an information processing system; prosthetics that interface with the nervous system.</li>
                <li><strong>Management & Society:</strong> Organizational cybernetics applies these principles to manage complex companies and economies (e.g., Stafford Beer's Viable System Model).</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Advanced Project -->
        <section id="project">
            <h2>Advanced Project: Braitenberg Vehicles</h2>
            <p>
                Valentino Braitenberg, a neuroanatomist, proposed a series of thought experiments in his book <em>"Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology"</em>. 
                He showed how simple mechanical connections between sensors and motors can yield complex, life-like behaviors like "fear", "aggression", and "love".
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Interact with the simulation below.</strong> These "vehicles" have two light sensors connected to two wheels. 
                By changing how they are wired, we change their "personality".
